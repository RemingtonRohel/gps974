# Goals for 2023

---

## Learn a new programming language (Rust)
I've been wanting to learn Rust for a few months now, and have already started reading the textbook on it.
I know that reading alone is not enough to learn though - I have to practice! So, to achieve my goal, I want to come up
with a project that excites me and implement it in Rust. Knowing another programming language, and one that is becoming
more prominent in the community, will be an asset for me in my professional career.

My roadmap for this goal is:
1. Find a project that I can solve with software and am excited about
2. Break that project into manageable milestones
3. Commit to a timeline for each milestone - maybe complete 1 per month, or something to that effect

This goal will help me in my career development by forging a new skill that increases my competence as a programmer.

### Reflection

This goal was by far the most exciting to me, and the one that I was most confident I could motivate myself to achieve by the end of the course. This goal provided an impetus and excuse for me to dedicate time towards learning Rust, which I was passionate about. The project I chose was to rewrite a piece of software used by the SuperDARN community for data processing. I have fully completed the first step in the processing chain and verified that my software produces results matching the standard software used by the community. Not only that, but for large files my software can parallelize and more optimally use resources, processing up to three times faster on my computer. Time constraints prevented me from continuing and adding in more steps of the processing chain.  
 
I am very happy with the progress I made and with the programming language in general, and I know for certain I will use it again on projects in the future. I feel that I have a working understanding of the programming language and have achieved the goal in full. All that said, I did not follow the roadmap that I originally set out for myself. Specifically, I did not set out a schedule for achieving milestones. I think this was due to two reasons: first, I have a hard time setting a schedule and sticking to it; and second, I became much too interested in getting the software working, so I dove right into it and didn’t let up until I reached a point where I was happy with my progress. I think with the commitments I had in my life over this course, this was the natural progression for this work. I quickly became busy with more pressing tasks and did not have time to peck away at my software project, so plowing it through it quickly is probably the only way that I would have achieved the goal.  

### Artifacts

The work I've done so far is all visible on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RemingtonRohel/backscatter-rs). I plan on continuing this project at some point in the future when I have time to make it a bonafide replacement for the old SuperDARN software package.

## Make a 5 year plan
I know that planning for my future is an area that I could afford to grow in. I want to develop a 5 year plan
in order to force myself to think hard about what I want in my life and career, and what I need to change to get there.
As a deliverable for this goal, I want to procure a document cataloguing several high-level goals for myself to be 
completed in the next 5 years.

My roadmap for this goal is:
1. Learn more about the career options I have available to me with my interests and education
2. Put some thought into what I want to do, what is important to me in a job, and what is best for my wife and I. 
3. Explore what I need to work on in order to align my life with the above

This goal will help me in my career development, wellness and life balance, and reflection and intrapersonal skills.

### Reflection

My goal of creating a five-year plan was a moderate success. I have dedicated much thought to my near future throughout this course and have had many conversations with my wife around the topic. I feel I have a better understanding of my ambitions and opportunities to pursue them than I did at the beginning of the course. However, I did not formalize any of this in writing or some other medium. I find that I lack productivity in tasks of this sort. Furthermore, I find that when major decisions arise, no matter how much thought I put into it, I almost always pick my gut reaction. I am surprisingly content with this reflection. I trust my gut feelings to guide me, and my reasoning to adjust when my guide is wrong, or I cannot follow. Looking back on the major decisions I have made in my life I am happy with the paths that this has led me down. For instance, I chose to switch universities after my first year, which originally filled me with a lot of regret. I have come to appreciate the decision and see that I am in a better place because of it. 

My learning coach pushed me to formalize this goal and I regret that I did not do more. I have entered a season of change in my life both professionally and personally; I wish I had used this course as an opportunity to try out a more formal planning process, as opposed to “building the plane while flying it” as I usually do.

## Sleep for 7.5+ hours per night, 5 nights a week
Sleep is not something that I prioritize. I want to work towards getting a healthy amount of sleep each week,
while being realistic that with social commitments and homework I won't always be able to sleep a certain amount each 
night. This goal will help to improve my health and also time management as I learn to prioritize tasks and
set deadlines for myself in order to meet my sleep goals. 

My roadmap for this goal is:
1. Work on hitting 7.5 hours of sleep at least twice per week. This should be easy.
2. Start being more diligent with my homework to avoid staying up late to finish it. There are enough hours in the week, if I don't squander them.
3. Meal plan more efficiently - Dedicating a day to making meals for the week takes up a lot less time than making individual meals each day or two.

This goal will help me develop better wellness and life balance to become a more healthy person.

### Reflection

This goal was spurred by my unhealthy sleep patterns that were present during the spring semester. These patterns were the result of my course load and time management strategies. For course work that I am not eager to complete, I have found that my productivity is near zero if the deadline is not near. Knowing this, I am happy to do other things until the deadline nears, knowing that I can always stay up late to complete the work. I did this often in my undergraduate degree, and again during the spring semester. My mental health is significantly better when I deliberately choose to do things I enjoy and work when I know I will be productive. However, those days when I am working often bleed into late nights, sometimes extremely. I even pulled two sleepless nights in the spring semester to finish up assignments that were due the following day. This is a pretty clear failure of the roadmap that I originally planned with this goal. Once the semester completed, my sleep habits improved. A challenge I faced is that I travelled internationally four times since January and to deal with jet lag each time. On average since May I have been spending 7.5 hours in bed per night, meeting my original goal, but I would not consider this goal a success. I know that if I don’t take deliberate action I will fall into the same pattern when I have deadlines to meet.  

### Artifacts

The shifted sleep times are proof that I was in other time zones! In February, I was in Japan. In May, I was in Orlando then South Africa. At the end of June, I was in San Diego.

## Learning Coach Log

Unfortunately, I don't have another log of my meetings with my learning coach Fred. I have been meeting with him most Tuesdays for over a year now as part of a life group with my church. We've had many informal conversations around my goals, but only the one formal conversation recorded below.
