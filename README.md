# GPS 974

## About Me
My name is Remington Rohel, I am a M.Sc. student in the Department of Physics and Engineering Physics at the University 
of Saskatchewan working on expanding the capabilities of the SuperDARN Canada digital radars. My research so far has 
been focused on creating full field-of-view imaging modes and interpreting bistatic experiments conducted with pairs of 
SuperDARN radars. 

Outside of my work and education, I enjoy playing sports, cooking, and playing board games with my wife and our friends.
I also love watching movies, especially anything with a twist ending or directed by Christopher Nolan.
