# Goals for 2023

## Learn a new programming language (Rust)
I've been wanting to learn Rust for a few months now, and have already started reading the textbook on it.
I know that reading alone is not enough to learn though - I have to practice! So, to achieve my goal, I want to come up
with a project that excites me and implement it in Rust. Knowing another programming language, and one that is becoming
more prominent in the community, will be an asset for me in my professional career.

My roadmap for this goal is:
1. Find a project that I can solve with software and am excited about
2. Break that project into manageable milestones
3. Commit to a timeline for each milestone - maybe complete 1 per month, or something to that effect

This goal will help me in my career development by forging a new skill that increases my competence as a programmer.

### Artifacts

The work I've done so far is all visible on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RemingtonRohel/backscatter-rs).

## Make a 5 year plan
I know that planning for my future is an area that I could afford to grow in. I want to develop a 5 year plan
in order to force myself to think hard about what I want in my life and career, and what I need to change to get there.
As a deliverable for this goal, I want to procure a document cataloguing several high-level goals for myself to be 
completed in the next 5 years.

My roadmap for this goal is:
1. Learn more about the career options I have available to me with my interests and education
2. Put some thought into what I want to do, what is important to me in a job, and what is best for my wife and I. 
3. Explore what I need to work on in order to align my life with the above

This goal will help me in my career development, wellness and life balance, and reflection and intrapersonal skills.

## Sleep for 7.5+ hours per night, 5 nights a week
Sleep is not something that I prioritize. I want to work towards getting a healthy amount of sleep each week,
while being realistic that with social commitments and homework I won't always be able to sleep a certain amount each 
night. This goal will help to improve my health and also time management as I learn to prioritize tasks and
set deadlines for myself in order to meet my sleep goals. 

My roadmap for this goal is:
1. Work on hitting 7.5 hours of sleep at least twice per week. This should be easy.
2. Start being more diligent with my homework to avoid staying up late to finish it. There are enough hours in the week, if I don't squander them.
3. Meal plan more efficiently - Dedicating a day to making meals for the week takes up a lot less time than making individual meals each day or two.

This goal will help me develop better wellness and life balance to become a more healthy person.
